"""Pop embed jobs off the VM's Redis, run Essentia locally, write back.

The ARM VM can't import essentia, so /seed queues cold tracks instead of
analyzing them; this worker is the other half. Run it on a machine where
essentia imports (the Mac), pointed at the VM's Redis:

One process, one job at a time: on-demand taps trickle in and analysis is
~1 s. Bulk backfill stays push_tracks.py's job.
