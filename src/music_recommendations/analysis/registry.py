"""One table of classification heads: file, size, verified node names.

Node names are NOT uniform across heads (spec §2.1) — every head added
here must have its names checked against the actual graph, not assumed.
fetch_models.py and heads.py both read this table; adding an axis that
rides on the embedding is a one-row diff here.

# The table stays because it is the extension point: re-adding an axis that
# rides on the embedding is one row here plus one FEATURE_KEYS entry, and no
# other lane changes. Node names must be verified against the actual graph for
# every head — the TensorflowPredict2D defaults do not hold (spec §2.1). These
# two were verified and are kept here so re-adding them costs nothing:
#
#   "genre":     Head("genre_discogs400-discogs-effnet-1.pb", 400,
#                     "serving_default_model_Placeholder", "PartitionedCall:0"),

#                     "model/Placeholder", "model/Sigmoid"),
#
# The four binary mood heads used "model/Placeholder" -> "model/Softmax", and
# disagree on which class index is positive; heads.py resolves that per head
# from the model's own JSON rather than assuming.
