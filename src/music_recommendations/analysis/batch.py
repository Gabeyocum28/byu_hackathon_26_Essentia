"""Analyze many files at once, across processes.

analyze_track handles one file and is the contract this lane owes everyone
else. This adds throughput on top of it, which matters once a corpus is
thousands of tracks rather than hundreds.

Processes, not threads: the work is a TensorFlow forward pass plus DSP, both
CPU-bound and holding the GIL, so threads buy nothing. Each worker builds its
own EffNet (the module-level singletons in embedding.py are per-process), so
there is a fixed startup cost of roughly a second per worker -- irrelevant
across thousands of files, dominant across ten.

Callers stay in charge of WHEN analysis happens (spec §7). This is only about
how fast it goes once they have decided to.
