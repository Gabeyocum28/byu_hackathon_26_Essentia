"""analyze_track: MP3 path in, dict of named feature vectors out (spec §2.1).

Pure — no cache, no HTTP, no Redis. Callers (server, corpus/ingest)
decide when to run it and where results live. Returned dict keys must
match contract/features.py FEATURE_KEYS.

Callers that persist or compare these vectors also want FEATURES_VERSION
and METRICS from .schema — the version to know when cached vectors went
stale, the metrics to know how to compare them. Import them from
music_recommendations.analysis.schema directly to skip loading essentia.
