"""Batch loop: download preview -> analyze_track -> write Redis.

Same analysis function the server calls on demand; different caller
(spec §7). Skips tracks already in Redis; one bad track never kills a run.

Downloads and analysis are bounded by different things, so they run
differently: downloads are I/O and go on threads, analysis is a TensorFlow
forward pass and goes on processes (analysis.batch.analyze_many). Working in
batches keeps both busy without holding thousands of embeddings in memory at
once -- 10k of them is ~100 MB of Python floats before anything is written.

The two stages overlap: batch N+1 is already downloading while batch N is
being analyzed. Measured on a 10-core run, downloading a batch and analyzing
it strictly in turn left the CPU idle for most of the wall clock, because a
preview fetch is network latency and nothing else.

Each mp3 leaves the working cache the moment its features reach Redis. The
features ARE the product; the audio is scratch, and at ~225 KB a preview a
corpus of tens of thousands would fill the disk for nothing.

Set ARCHIVE_DIR to keep them anyway -- point it at an external disk and the
preview is MOVED there instead of deleted, which turns a FEATURES_VERSION bump
from a re-download of the whole corpus at Deezer's rate limit into a local,
CPU-only re-analysis. Downloads still land on the internal disk first, so an
archive that is full, slow, or unplugged costs the archive, never the run.
