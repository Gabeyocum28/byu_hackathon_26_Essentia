"""Math for GET /viz/map — the demo/debug galaxy of embedding space.

NOT part of contract/contract.md (like GET /). The map is always a 2D PCA of
the EMBEDDING matrix regardless of axis: the picture answers "where does the
music lie", the axis only changes which scores are attached to the recs.

PCA over eigen-libraries: the corpus is numpy-sized, the projection is two
principal components of an (n, 1280) matrix, and we already hold that matrix
in process (app._MATRIX_CACHE). Rows are L2-normalized first so the picture
matches the cosine geometry the ranking actually uses — otherwise loudness
becomes the first principal component.
